# Verification log

Every figure in `src/domain` was transcribed without access to the gazette. On
2026-09-10 the authoritative document arrived (TMPR8, 4/9/25 version, Housing & Urban
Planning Department). This records what was checked against it and what came back.

**Headline: three transcriptions were verified exactly right, and six real bugs were
found — five of which made the engine permit more than the byelaws allow.**

That ratio matters. The engine was not uniformly wrong, and the two secondary web
sources consulted before the document arrived were *both wrong* about the one rule they
described. Verification has to be against the source, not against consensus.

## Resolved

### V-001 — Front setback derived from plot area — ENGINE CORRECT
Two web sources claimed the front margin was driven by abutting road width. The gazette
table at Para 3.2.4.1 is keyed on **plot area**, exactly as the engine had it:

| Plot area | Front | Rear | Side-1 | Side-2 | Typology |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Up to 150 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Row-housing |
| >150 to 300 | 3 | 1.5 | 0 | 0 | Row-housing |
| >300 to 500 | 3 | 3 | 0 | 0 | Row-housing |
| >500 to 1200 | 4.5 | 4.5 | 1.5 | 0 | Semi-detached |
| >1200 | 6 | 6 | 1.5 | 1.5 | Detached |

**Closed. No change required.** Both secondary sources were wrong; one appears to have
blended in another state's development control rules.

### V-002 — Telescopic FAR ladder — ENGINE CORRECT
Three mutually inconsistent ladders existed before consolidation. The one retained
matches the gazette exactly: 150 @ 2.0, >150–300 @ 1.8, >300–500 @ 1.75, >500–1200 @ 1.5,
>1200 @ 1.25. **Closed. No change required.**

### High-rise progressive setbacks — ENGINE CORRECT
Para 3.2.4.9 matches the engine at every band, including the >51 m row (15/12/12/12).
Note the scope qualifier: the table applies to occupancies *other than* single/multi
units. **Closed.**

## Bugs found and fixed

### B-001 — Max FAR ceiling was ignored (over-permission)
The gazette sets **Max FAR = 2.0 in every band** of the plotted residential table. The
engine added a purchasable increment on top of the telescopic base and so permitted up
to 2.4. It over-permitted on every plot below about 1200 m² — up to **105 m² of floor
area that cannot be sanctioned**.
*Fixed: the ceiling now comes from the table and purchasable FAR is the gap beneath it.*

### B-002 — Group housing Base FAR escalated with road width
The engine raised Base FAR 1.75 → 2.5 as the road widened. The gazette holds Base FAR
**flat** (1.5 built-up, 2.5 non-built-up) and uses road width to set **Max** FAR
(9–12 m → 2.0, >12–18 m → 3.0, >18–24 m → 3.0, >24–45 m → 5.25, >45 m → unrestricted).
Base and ceiling were conflated.
*Fixed: base is a property of occupancy and area type; road width sets the ceiling.*

### B-003 — Commercial FAR had the same inversion
Gazette: base 1.5 built-up / 1.75 non-built-up; Max FAR ≤12 m → 2.1, >12–24 m → 3.0,
>24–45 m → 5.0, >45 m → unrestricted. *Fixed alongside B-002.*

### B-004 — Green-building FAR applied in the wrong place
Chapter 9.3 grants 3% / 5% / 7% "additional FAR **on availed FAR**", and states five
times that it is "**over and above the MFAR**". The engine folded it into Base FAR and
then capped the result — understating the entitlement while consuming purchasable
headroom the gazette does not touch. The percentages themselves were right.
*Fixed: granted above the ceiling.*

### B-005 — Commercial setbacks missing the >3000 m² band
The gazette has five bands; the engine had four, so any commercial plot above 3000 m²
received 6/3/3/3 where 12/6/6/6 is required — **half the required front setback**.
*Fixed.*

### B-006 — Height ceiling followed occupancy instead of plot size
Gazette 3.2.4.1: "for all single/multi-units less than 300 square meters plot size,
three floors with stilts up to 15 meter … and on plots above 300 square meters, four
storeys with stilts up to 17.5-meter height". The engine capped single-unit dwellings at
15 m regardless of plot size, under-permitting height on plots above 300 m².
*Fixed: the ceiling follows the plot.*

## Still open

### V-003 — Non-commercial occupancies routed to the commercial FAR matrix
Offices, hospitals, schools, assembly and industrial uses still read the commercial
road-width table because no separate matrix has been extracted yet. The gazette has
per-occupancy tables; they have not been transcribed.

### V-004 — Compounding schedule is a reconstruction
Chapter 16 has not been read against the document. Every rupee figure remains unverified.

### V-005 — Occupancy thresholds are inferred
Minimum road widths, plot sizes and parking ratios for the sixteen occupancies were
reasoned from the four that existed, not read from the gazette.

### Not yet modelled
- Built-up versus non-built-up area type is now in the FAR engine but not in the UI, so
  every project is assessed as built-up — the more restrictive reading.
- Para 3.2.4.9 Note-1: on a plot facing two roads of different widths, the side facing
  the **wider** road is the front.
- Para 3.2.4.9 Note-2: an alternative compliance path trading ground-floor setback
  against upper-floor stepping.
- Table Note-2 on corner plots distinguishes new layouts from already-approved ones.

## Method

One entry per claim. Record what the engine asserts, what challenges it, what evidence
was seen, and what would settle it. **Close an entry only against the gazette text**, and
quote the clause when you do.
